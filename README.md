## Project title: Personalized Fashion Suggestions App Based on ML method
Everyone wants to wear fashion clothes because how you look is very important for you. Thinking about what to wear is time consuming for all kinds of occasions, such as job interviews, weddings, vacations and even everyday when you go to work/class. That is why people invested hours and hours on clothes shopping. However, the time that invested on shopping does not always return a positive result. At shopping mall, there are thousands of clothes and shoes, and you have to go through all of the brands, styles, colors and sizes to find the perfect one for you. Sometimes you bought the clothes but later you realized it’s outdated and you cannot return anymore, and sometimes you found the good design clothes but it does not have the size you want, and sometime you found the perfect size perfect design but it’s too expensive to afford. 

Therefore, we present an algorithm that will suggest you the unique fashion clothes for you. We will have you fill in a survey of your body size, personal background and your preferences. We collected our data of clothes from ZARA website. Based on the preferences you chose, we will suggest you clothes which got a high score through our image classification model. You can click “LIKE”, “DISLIKE”, “SAVE TO CART” to deal with our suggestions.
